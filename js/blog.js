        "description": "<div class='row'>   <div class='col-md-6'>      <p>'We had an interesting discussion here on Javascript vs Python as a first language.  While both are decent, I'd probably lean towards learning Javascript first and to then move into Python/PHP (backend) second, then perhaps into mobile like Kotlin/Swift (with memory management & design) if so motivated.  For a beginner, having that immediate visual feedback is necessary to keep motivated.  My primary concern with Python is that it even though it is a more 'solid' language it is also command-line only, and that's just plain boring for most people who have no idea why they'd even want to create a command-line program, much less what a command-line is.

        "description": "<i>Original Link: <a href='https://geektastic.com/coding-tests-for-interviews' target='_blank'>geektastic.com</a></i> <h3>Creating take-home coding tests for interviews</h3><p>Lots of companies use take-home coding tests for interviews during the hiring process.</p> <p>It's REALLY difficult to create that perfect online coding test that keeps the best developers interested.</p> <p>You can increase the effectiveness of a coding test for interview by using one simple rule….</p> <h3>Make the take-home code test for interview as close to the real world as you can.</h3> <p>We have a number of take-home code tests on our platform that are used in the early stages of an interview process, and the ones that receive the best feedback, the ones that have the highest percentage take up rate and interestingly the ones that generate the most effort are the ones that feel real world.</p> <p>If your business is e-commerce - build a take-home code challenge where the task is to build a shopping basket or checkout (we have one of those), if your business is booking flights ask the candidate to build a flight booking page - even better have them integrate with your API, serve up some products to add to the basket or some dummy flight data to parse and pull into the webpage.</p> <p>Having spoken to developers this is the single biggest factor that has kept software engineers interested in various challenges over the years. There is nothing more frustrating that receiving a code test do do for an interview, and seeing it is another boring algorithm like checking a string for parenthesis counts, or sorting a list without using inbuilt functions.</p> <p>Doing multiple code tests can be time consuming and tedious if you are applying for multiple jobs. When the challenge is closer to the real role it starts to get the candidate engaged with the brand, they feel like they are actually starting working there - psychologically this is a huge win. Candidates who aren't that interested in the challenge will naturally not do their best - therefore it kills multiple birds with one stone.</p> <p>One of the best ways of making your take home code challenge close to real world is to make sure the challenge poses a problem within the general business domain of the company.</p> <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you take this to too far and make this too domain specific, you'll end up alienating people and could end up with a coding challenge that only lets you hire people who already work for you - so remember to strike a balance.</p> <b>Code tests should all fulfil the following</b> <ul><li>Open for creative interpretation, <li>Marked by a human (if you have your coding challenges marked by a machine - please stop. Machine marking is a binary solution to a non-binary problem. People are not binary (not matter how geeky we talk). For more on this topic please read our post <a href='https://geektastic.com/blog/how-to-review-a-peer-review-code-challenge' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li><li>Used for open discussion later</li><li>Production quality code requested (Clean Code).</li><li>More than input/output of a single method.Eg, a light UI, an object model, an API call.</li><li>Simple and clear - can be summarised in a single sentence.</li><li>Time suggestion, not limit</li></ul> <b>Several BIG Topics came up in the process of our discussions:</b> <ul><li>Timed challenges.</li><li>IDE (Code Editor).</li><li>Realisticness of it being like the actual job.</li></ul> <p>So let's look at each of those points in detail.</p> <b>Timed challenges</b> <p>There are two schools of thought on this - We asked Andy Davis (who helped write this page his thoughts) who also asked <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/zfoltin/' target='_blank'>Zeno Foltin, a London-based (polyglot) software developer</a> here's what he said (hint they're not big fans of times challenges)</p> <p>Challenges with a hard cut off time. It seems obvious why companies might impose a time limits:</p> <p>Create a level playing field for comparison - if they have the exact same amount of time and no prior knowledge, we can accurately compare candidate solutions.Candidates know upfront that a fixed amount of of time is needed not a snow ball into hours/days and therefore are more likely to accept doing the challenge</p> <p>Zeno and I put our heads together on this one and we think not enough thought is put into the downsides of that time limit. For example:It doesn't actually measure how well they will do on the job as the time pressures in the job are not the same as examination pressures.Faster developers are NOT better developers.A candidate who is slightly slower but can model the domain well, TDD and produce something infinitely better than speedy gonzales (who only writes procedural code) may get unfairly compared as a worse developer if they couldn't get that across in the timeframe.</p> <p>Zeno said:</p> <p>“I don't think timed challenges provide any value in measuring how well the candidate will do on the job. If it's about trying to find out how someone handles pressure, do it in a pair-programming session maybe. I think it's silly to think in our creative industry that putting such pressure on people will bring the best out of them.”</p> <p>So whilst we don't think timed challenges are completely useless, it just might not be the type of comparison they think they are making - possibly just a superficial comparison.The compromise here is to have a time limit but make it generous enough that the candidate has time to try out a few ideas. The last thing you want to do is cut everyone off mid flow - this would remove the benefit of having a test in the first place.</p> <h3>IDE</h3><p>Believe it or not, some coding challenge systems <b>HackerRank, Codility</b> actually force you to write and compile code in the browser - it seems to have become a bit of a fad recently. It's pretty nifty but it only really works for simple code. It seems to have benefits of scale for the companies using them as the computer tests the inputs and outputs for correctness - but <b>this shows very little respect to the candidate and actually makes their life much harder. It is unable to provide rich intellisense or access to commonly used frameworks or testing tools.</b></p> <p>Developers like their tools and we are no different. Writing code in the browser is not part of our weaponry and will not be something required on the job. Browser based code editors are great for tutorials and quickly trying something out you've just been taught but as a candidate testing tool, this should seriously be reconsidered.</p> <h3>Likeness to the actual job</h3><p>We know that is it impossible to condense the real nature of the job down into a coding challenge. But there really doesn't seem to be any point in asking a developer to complete something like an in-memory algorithm to return them the correct change from a vending machine. Sure, there are some algorithms in there and order of complexity to think about. However, if the job isn't about solving little puzzles, it really doesn't appear relevant.</p> <p>Andy was once sent a zip file from an online fashion retailer and told to refactor it. Whilst this sort of request is a little bit lazy - at least this is probably closer to the real job. Refactoring legacy code is part of almost every job. Furthermore it was actually in their domain. So, big points to them for this challenge, it was enjoyable. The only downside of that is that he never heard anything back (after spending 2 hours on the test too) - this is one of the biggest bugbears we have as developers.</p> <b>The bottom line around getting challenges close to the real world is:</b> <p>Avoid algorithms unless that really is what you are hiring for.</p><p>Avoid tests that were clearly designed for a different industry.</p><p>Be more honest with your coding challenge, if you are hiring a bug fixer, how about a challenge where you need to fix a couple of bugs</p> <i>written by: Andy Davis</i> <p>About Andy Davis</p> <p>Andy is a software developer. He's been writing software for over 20 years and helps businesses solve interesting business problems, by helping them create the right software.

        "description": "<p>STARTING TOMORROW, GOOGLE'S Chrome browser will automatically pause web ads that use Flash.</p> <p>That means that videos and animations in ads using Adobe's Flash technology will no longer autoplay in the world's most-used browser. Ads using HTML5, on the other hand, will continue to work.</p> <p>The decision, first revealed in June on Google+, is the latest nail in Flash's coffin, which is great news for the web: Flash is a bloated, insecure battery hog, and it deserves to die.</p> <p>Fortunately, Google doesn't appear to be the only organization that feels that way. Last month, Mozilla blocked Flash from running on its Firefox browser until Adobe released a new version that fixed some particularly egregious security problems that were revealed in a leak of security company Hacking Team's internal documents. Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos also recently called on browser makers to stop supporting Flash altogether. In anticipation of that development, Facebook has slowly been replacing its own videos with HTML5-based alternatives.</p> <p>Advertisers have been the big pro-Flash holdouts, but Amazon has said that it will no longer accept Flash advertisement on its network of sites. Google's move to pause Flash ads is even bigger; it could be just the push the industry needs to finally move on to better technologies.</p>  <p><strong>Posted by: <a href='https://www.wired.com/author/kfinley/' target='_blank'>Klint Finley</a></strong></p>",

        "description": "<p>Chrome's experimental Canary channel and Safari's WebKit nightly builds both now support all of the Photoshop-inspired blend modes for CSS Shaders, part of <p>Adobe's effort to bring Photoshop-style filter tools to the web.</p>To see the new blend modes in action, grab a copy of the latest Chrome Canary or WebKit nightly builds, enable the CSS Shaders option in about:flags and point your browser to Adobe's sample code over on Codepen. Previously, CSS Shaders required a special build of WebKit [Update: As Adobe's Alan Greenblatt points out in the comments, CSS shader support has been in Chrome stable since v25 (you still need to enable the flag). But if you want to play around with these new blend modes then you'll need Canary (or a WebKit nightly).]</p> <p>The new blend mode support is part of Adobe's CSS Shaders proposal, which recently became part of the W3C's CSS Filter Effects specification. There are two types of shaders in the spec, CSS fragment shaders, which provide features similar to what Photoshop's blending modes offer, and CSS vertex shaders, which handle the 3D animation filters we've showcased in the past.</p> <p>The blending modes currently available include all the familiar options you'll find in Adobe Photoshop, such as multiply, screen, overlay, luminosity and other photographer favorites.</p> <p>For more details and links to the corresponding specs, be sure to check out this post from Max Vujovic, who is working on the CSS Filters implementation in WebKit and Blink.</p> <p>As the CSS Filter Effects specification progresses through the standardization process (and stabilizes), hopefully other browsers will add support as well.</p><strong>Posted By:<a href='https://www.webmonkey.com/author/luxagraf/' target='_blank'> Scott Gilbertson</a></strong>",
